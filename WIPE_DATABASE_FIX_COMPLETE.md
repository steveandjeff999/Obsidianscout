# Wipe Database Fix - Complete

## Problem Resolved
✅ **"Error: No scouting team number found for current user"** has been fixed

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Empty String Team Numbers**: The "admin" user had an empty string `''` as their team number
2. **Zero Team Number Issue**: Users with team number `0` (admin/superadmin) were incorrectly rejected
3. **Faulty Logic**: The original code used `if not scouting_team_number:` which treats `0`, `None`, and `''` as falsy

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. User Data Issues (Fixed)
- ✅ **"admin" user**: Had empty string `''` → Fixed to `0` (admin access)
- ✅ **"superadmin" user**: Had `0` but was rejected → Logic fixed to accept `0`
- ✅ **"0" user**: Had `0` but was rejected → Logic fixed to accept `0`  
- ✅ **"bob" user**: Had `0` but was rejected → Logic fixed to accept `0`

### 2. Logic Fix in `app/routes/data.py`
**Before (Problematic)**:
```python
if not scouting_team_number:
    flash("Error: No scouting team number found for current user.", "danger")
    return redirect(url_for('data.index'))
```

**After (Fixed)**:
```python
# Check if scouting team number is None or empty string (but allow 0 for admin/superadmin)
if scouting_team_number is None or scouting_team_number == '':
    flash("Error: No scouting team number found for current user.", "danger")
    return redirect(url_for('data.index'))
```

## User Team Assignments (Current Status)
- **admin**: Team 0 (administrative data)
- **superadmin**: Team 0 (administrative data)  
- **stevejeff999**: Team 3937 (team-specific data)
- **Seth Herod**: Team 5454 (team-specific data)
- **0**: Team 0 (administrative data)
- **jim**: Team 5568 (team-specific data)
- **bob**: Team 0 (administrative data)

## How Wipe Database Now Works
1. **Team 0 Users** (admin/superadmin): Will wipe administrative/system data
2. **Team Number Users** (5454, 5568, etc.): Will wipe only their team's data
3. **Invalid Users** (None or empty string): Will get proper error message

## Team Isolation Benefits
- ✅ **Team 5454** data is isolated from **Team 5568** data
- ✅ **Team 0** (admin) data is separate from team-specific data
- ✅ Each team can only wipe their own data
- ✅ Prevents accidental cross-team data deletion

## Verification Results
- ✅ All 7 users can now use the wipe database function
- ✅ No more "No scouting team number found" errors
- ✅ Team isolation is properly maintained
- ✅ Admin users (team 0) can manage administrative data

**Status: ✅ COMPLETE - Wipe database function works correctly for all users**
