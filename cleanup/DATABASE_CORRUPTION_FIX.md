#  Database Corruption Fix - CRITICAL

## Issue Resolved: SQLite Database Corruption During Sync

###  **Problem**
The error `sqlite3.DatabaseError: file is not a database` was occurring because:

1. **File sync was copying SQLite database files** while they were being used
2. **Database files were being overwritten** during active connections
3. **WAL and SHM files** (SQLite transaction logs) were being synced incorrectly

###  **Solution Implemented**

#### 1. **Database File Exclusion**
Updated `_get_directory_checksums()` to exclude:
- `.db`, `.sqlite`, `.sqlite3` files
- `.db-wal`, `.db-shm` (SQLite WAL mode files)
- `.lock` files
- Specific files: `app.db`, `database.db`, `scouting.db`

#### 2. **API Protection**
Enhanced upload/download endpoints to block database files:
- `POST /api/sync/files/upload` - returns 403 for database files
- `GET /api/sync/files/download` - returns 403 for database files

#### 3. **Proper Database Sync**
- Database sync now uses **data-level synchronization** (SQL operations)
- **Never copies database files directly**
- Uses database transactions for safety

###  **Technical Details**

#### Excluded File Patterns:
```python
excluded_extensions = {'.db', '.sqlite', '.sqlite3', '.db-wal', '.db-shm', '.lock'}
excluded_files = {'app.db', 'database.db', 'scouting.db', 'app.db-wal', 'app.db-shm'}
```

#### Safe Sync Operations:
-  **Configuration files** (`config/` folder)
-  **Upload files** (`uploads/` folder) 
-  **Log files** (non-database logs)
-  **Static assets**
-  **Database files** (handled separately via data sync)

###  **Deployment Instructions**

1. **Stop all servers** that experienced corruption
2. **Restore database** from backup (if needed)
3. **Deploy updated sync code** with database file exclusions
4. **Restart servers** - sync will now be safe
5. **Test sync** between servers - no more corruption

###  **Verification**

Check that sync is working safely:
```bash
# Should NOT include .db files
curl "https://server:5000/api/sync/files/checksums?path=instance"

# Should be blocked
curl -X POST "https://server:5000/api/sync/files/upload" -F "file=@app.db"
# Expected: 403 Forbidden
```

###  **Prevention Checklist**

-  Database files excluded from file sync
-  API endpoints block database file transfers  
-  Data-level database sync implemented
-  Transaction safety added
-  Error handling improved

### Ô∏è **Important Notes**

1. **Never sync SQLite files directly** - always use data-level sync
2. **Database synchronization** happens through structured data exchange
3. **File sync** is only for configuration, uploads, and static files
4. **Each server maintains its own database file** - data is synchronized between them

** Database corruption issue resolved! Sync is now safe for production use.**
