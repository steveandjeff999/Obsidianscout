# Quick Fix for Graph Generation Issues

## Issue Summary
The main problem with the current `/graphs` implementation is that `points_data` variable scope and indentation issues are preventing proper graph generation.

## Root Causes
1. **Variable Scope**: `points_data` is only defined in certain conditional blocks but used in others
2. **Indentation**: Mixed indentation levels cause Python syntax errors
3. **Logic Flow**: When `data_view='matches'`, the code path doesn't properly prepare `points_data`

## Solution Applied
1. **Fixed Variable Scope**: Moved `points_data` initialization outside conditional blocks
2. **Ensured Always Available**: `points_data` is now calculated for all cases using `team_metrics`
3. **Improved Logic**: Teams are now processed even when no scouting data exists

## Current Status
- ✅ Server starts successfully
- ✅ Basic UI improvements work (12 graph types, categorized selection)
- ✅ `data_view='averages'` works and shows graphs
- ❌ `data_view='matches'` still has issues due to remaining indentation problems

## Next Steps Needed
1. Fix remaining indentation issues in the large conditional blocks
2. Ensure all graph type handlers are properly indented
3. Test with actual scouting data
4. Add proper error handling for edge cases

## Temporary Workaround
For now, users should use `data_view='averages'` which works correctly and shows the new graph types.
