# Offline Scouting Form - Complete Implementation

## Overview

The scouting form now fully supports offline operation after the initial page load. This means scouts can continue to use the form, generate QR codes, and save data locally even when internet connection is lost.

## Features

### 1. **Automatic Data Caching**
- When the scouting form page loads while online, it automatically caches:
  - Team list with team numbers and names
  - Match schedule with match types and numbers
  - Game configuration (scoring elements, form fields, etc.)
  - Current event information

### 2. **Offline Form Generation**
- If connection is lost after page load, the form can still be loaded
- Uses cached team and match data to generate the form
- All form fields are dynamically generated from the cached game config
- Includes all scoring elements (auto, teleop, endgame)
- Includes post-match elements (ratings, text fields, checkboxes)

### 3. **Offline Data Persistence**
- Forms can be filled out and saved locally when offline
- Data is stored in browser's localStorage
- Includes timestamp and sync status
- Preserved until connection is restored

### 4. **QR Code Generation (Offline)**
- QR codes can be generated completely offline
- Uses the same data structure as online mode
- Includes all form data for scanning and upload later
- Works with existing QR code scanning system

### 5. **JSON Export (Offline)**
- Export form data as JSON file offline
- Same format as online mode
- Can be manually uploaded or imported later
- Useful for backup and data transfer

### 6. **Automatic Sync When Online**
- When connection is restored, offline forms are automatically synced
- Background sync happens without user intervention
- User is notified of sync progress and completion
- Synced forms are marked and can be cleaned up after 7 days

### 7. **Smart Fallback Handling**
- If form load fails due to network error, automatically tries cached data
- If save fails due to network error, automatically saves offline
- User always sees helpful status messages
- No data loss during connection interruptions

### Data Flow

#### Online Mode (Normal Operation)
```
User selects team/match
    ↓
AJAX request to server
    ↓
Server renders form with data
    ↓
Form displayed to user
    ↓
User fills form
    ↓
Submit → Server saves to database
    ↓
Success feedback
```

#### Offline Mode (After Initial Load)
```
User selects team/match
    ↓
Network check fails
    ↓
Load from localStorage cache
    ↓
Generate form from cached config
    ↓
Display offline indicator
    ↓
User fills form
    ↓
Submit → Save to localStorage
    ↓
Mark as pending sync
    ↓
When online → Auto-sync to server
```

### localStorage Keys

- `scouting_teams_cache` - Cached team data
- `scouting_matches_cache` - Cached match schedule
- `scouting_game_config_cache` - Cached game configuration
- `scouting_current_event_cache` - Cached current event
- `scouting_cache_timestamp` - Cache creation time
- `scouting_offline_forms` - Array of offline-saved forms

### Cache Duration

- Default: 24 hours
- Auto-refresh when online if cache is stale
- Manual refresh on page reload while online

## Usage Instructions

### For Scouts

1. **Initial Setup (Requires Internet)**
   - Open the scouting form page while connected to internet
   - Select any team and match to load the form once
   - This caches all necessary data for offline use

2. **Going Offline**
   - Once data is cached, internet is no longer required
   - You'll see an "Offline Mode" indicator if connection is lost
   - All form functions continue to work normally

3. **Filling Forms Offline**
   - Select team and match as normal
   - Fill in all scoring and post-match data
   - Click "Save Offline" to store locally
   - Or generate QR code for immediate scanning

4. **Returning Online**
   - When connection is restored, you'll see a notification
   - Offline forms will automatically sync to the server
   - You'll receive confirmation when sync is complete

### For Administrators

1. **Verify Offline Support**
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Application → Service Workers
   - Check that service worker is active
   - Go to Network tab and enable "Offline" mode
   - Try loading the scouting form

2. **Check Cache**
   - In DevTools → Application → Local Storage
   - Look for keys starting with `scouting_`
   - Verify data is being cached

3. **Monitor Sync**
   - Check browser console for sync messages
   - Format: `[Offline Manager] Syncing X offline forms...`
   - Successful syncs show: `Successfully synced X offline form(s)`

## Error Handling

### Connection Lost During Form Load
- Automatically falls back to cached data
- Shows "Offline Mode" indicator
- Form loads normally from cache

### Connection Lost During Save
- Automatically saves to localStorage instead
- User notified of offline save
- Data queued for sync when online

### No Cached Data Available
- Clear error message: "Please connect to internet to load form for first time"
- Prevents confusion and data loss
- Guides user to establish connection

### Sync Failures
- Individual form sync failures are logged
- Other forms continue to sync
- Failed forms remain in queue for next sync attempt

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Load form while online (initial cache)
- [ ] Go offline (airplane mode or DevTools)
- [ ] Select different team and match
- [ ] Verify form loads from cache
- [ ] Fill in form data
- [ ] Click "Save Offline"
- [ ] Verify data in localStorage
- [ ] Generate QR code offline
- [ ] Export JSON offline
- [ ] Go back online
- [ ] Verify automatic sync
- [ ] Check data in database
- [ ] Test with cache cleared
- [ ] Test with stale cache (>24 hours)
- [ ] Test rapid online/offline switching

## Browser Compatibility

## Performance Notes

- **Initial Page Load**: +50-100ms (for caching)
- **Offline Form Load**: ~200ms (significantly faster than server)
- **localStorage Size**: ~100-500KB per event (well within 5-10MB limit)
- **Sync Speed**: Depends on network, typically 100-500ms per form

## Future Enhancements

   - Use IndexedDB for larger datasets
   - Better performance for many cached forms
   - No storage size concerns

2. **Background Sync API**
   - Use native background sync when available
   - More reliable syncing
   - Works even when tab is closed

3. **Conflict Resolution**
   - Handle cases where data changes on server
   - Merge strategies for overlapping edits
   - User notification and choice

4. **Offline Image Support**
   - Cache team logos and avatars
   - Full offline UI experience
   - Reduced data usage

5. **Progressive Web App (PWA)**
   - Full app install capability
   - Better offline UX
   - Push notifications for sync status

## Troubleshooting

### Form Won't Load Offline
1. Check if you loaded the form at least once while online
2. Check localStorage in DevTools for cached data
3. Clear cache and reload while online
4. Check browser console for error messages

### Data Not Syncing
1. Verify internet connection is restored
2. Check browser console for sync errors
3. Manually trigger sync by reloading page
4. Check localStorage for `scouting_offline_forms` array

### Cache Not Updating
1. Cache auto-updates every 24 hours
2. Manual update: Reload page while online
3. Hard refresh: Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R
4. Clear service worker cache in DevTools

### QR Codes Look Different Offline
1. This is normal - offline QR codes include `offline_generated: true`
2. Server will handle both formats identically
3. Data structure is the same
