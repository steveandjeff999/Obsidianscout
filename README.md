The online version is available at https://obsidianscout.com/. I will be making some improvements to this over the next few weeks to increase server uptime, as I am still testing it. Please note that the online version will likely have its database reset at the start of each FRC season. This reset will include all data and users. I will try to prevent user accounts from being reset at that time, but currently, that is not something I can do.
