## 🔧 ISSUES FIXED

### 1. ✅ **HTTP 500 Error in /api/sync/changes**
**Problem**: `cannot access local variable 'changes'`  
**Cause**: Variable scope issue - missing `else` branch in conditional  
**Fix**: Added proper else branch for non-catchup mode  
**File**: `app/routes/sync_api.py`

### 2. ✅ **JSON Parsing Errors in SyncLog**  
**Problem**: `Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)`  
**Cause**: sync_details stored as plain strings instead of JSON  
**Fix**: Updated sync_details format to use proper JSON  
**Files**: `app/utils/real_time_file_sync.py` (3 locations)  
**Result**: Repaired 32 existing malformed sync log entries

### 3. ✅ **Server Health Check Issues**
**Problem**: "Server hp is not healthy" warnings  
**Cause**: Health status not updating after successful pings  
**Fix**: Added proper ping status updates in connection tests  
**File**: `app/utils/simplified_sync.py`

### 4. ✅ **Database Change Tracking**
**Problem**: No test changes being created for sync  
**Cause**: Incorrect field names in test scripts  
**Fix**: Corrected DatabaseChange model usage  
**Result**: Successfully created and synced 3 test changes
