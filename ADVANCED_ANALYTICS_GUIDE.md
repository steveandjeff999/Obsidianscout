**Analysis Method:**
- Calculates combined scoring potential
- Identifies synergies
- Assesses phase coverage
- Rates alliance strength

**Synergy Detection:**
- Strong autonomous coverage
- Excellent teleoperated scoring
- Elite total output

**Alliance Ratings:**
- **Exceptional** (>120pts): Championship-caliber
- **Solid** (>80pts): Good playoff potential
- **Moderate** (>50pts): Can compete effectively
- **Developing** (<50pts): May struggle

## Technical Details

### Data Requirements
- **Minimum 3 matches** for trend analysis and consistency
- **Match data** with auto, teleop, and endgame breakdowns
- **Team metrics** calculated from scouting entries

### Calculation Methods

**Trend Analysis:**
```
First Half Avg = Average of first 50% of matches
Second Half Avg = Average of last 50% of matches
Trend % = ((Second Half - First Half) / First Half) * 100
```

**Consistency:**
```
Standard Deviation = sqrt(variance)
Coefficient of Variation = (StdDev / Average) * 100
```

**Predictions:**
```
Predicted Score = Recent Average * (1 + Trend% / 200)
Confidence = min(95, 50 + |Trend%| * 2)
```

**Alliance Strength:**
```
Combined Score = Team1 Total + Team2 Total
Win Probability = (Alliance Strength / Total Strength) * 100
```

### Response Format
All analytics responses include:
- Formatted text with emoji indicators
- Structured data objects for visualizations
- Confidence metrics where applicable
- Actionable recommendations

---

## Integration with Existing Features

### Works With:
- Team statistics queries
- Match result lookups
- Team comparisons
- Best teams queries

### Enhanced By:
- Spell correction for natural language
- Multi-part query decomposition
- Proactive suggestions
- Conversation context

---

## Query Patterns Supported

### Natural Language Variations:
- "is X improving?" / "is X getting better?"
- "will X win?" / "can X beat Y?"
- "how consistent is X?" / "how reliable is X?"
- "strengths of X" / "what is X good at?"
- "X and Y team up" / "alliance between X and Y"

### Shorthand Forms:
- "trends X" (team number without "team")
- "predict X" (assumes team prediction)
- "X consistency" (natural ordering)

---

## Best Practices

### For Trend Analysis:
- Review trends before playoffs to identify hot teams
- Compare early vs late season performance
- Track momentum shifts

### For Predictions:
- Use confidence levels to guide decisions
- Combine with human scouting observations
- Consider match type (practice vs qualification)

### For Alliance Selection:
- Evaluate consistency for reliability
- Check strengths/weaknesses for role fit
- Use alliance predictions for strategic pairing
- Consider peak performance as ceiling potential
