# Connections and Real-Time Sync Guide

Obsidian-Scout features multiple synchronization systems to ensure data consistency across devices, servers, and alliance partners.

## Overview

Sync mechanisms available:
- **Real-Time Replication**: Instant websocket-based sync for live collaboration
- **Catch-Up Sync**: Periodic synchronization for devices that were offline
- **Alliance Sync**: Share data with alliance partners during competitions
- **API Sync**: Automated imports from FIRST API and The Blue Alliance
- **Server-to-Server Sync**: Multi-instance deployments stay synchronized

## Real-Time Replication

### How It Works

- Uses **WebSocket** technology (Socket.IO) for bidirectional communication
- Changes propagate instantly (<100ms typically)
- Supports multiple concurrent users
- Automatic reconnection if connection drops
- Queue-based reliability - no data loss during brief disconnections

### Supported Operations

- **Scouting data**: New entries, edits, deletions
- **Pit scouting**: Team information updates
- **Strategy drawings**: Real-time collaborative canvas
- **Chat messages**: Direct messages, group chat
- **Configuration changes**: Game config, pit config updates
- **Match data**: Score updates, scheduling changes

### Monitoring Real-Time Sync

1. Check **connection indicator** in navbar (green dot = connected)
2. Go to **Admin** > **Sync Monitor** for detailed status
3. View queue size and worker status
4. See last sync timestamp
5. Monitor error rates

### Performance Considerations

- Optimized for low-bandwidth scenarios (minimum 3G connection)
- Data compressed before transmission
- Batching reduces overhead for bulk operations
- Priority queue ensures critical updates go first

## Catch-Up Sync

### Purpose

Catch-up sync handles scenarios where devices were offline or real-time sync failed:
- Devices returning from network outage
- New devices joining existing deployment
- Recovering from sync failures
- Periodic validation of data consistency

### Automatic Catch-Up

- Runs every **5 minutes** by default (configurable)
- Compares local database timestamps with remote
- Identifies missing or outdated records
- Downloads and applies changes
- Minimal bandwidth usage (only transfers differences)

### Manual Catch-Up Trigger

1. Go to **Admin** > **Sync Monitor**
2. Click **Trigger Catch-Up Sync**
3. Select sync scope:
   - **Full**: All tables
   - **Teams**: Team data only
   - **Matches**: Match data only
   - **Scouting Data**: Match scouting entries
4. Monitor progress indicator
5. Status updates in real-time

### Catch-Up Scheduler

- Background process runs continuously
- Configurable intervals in `app_config.json`
- Logs all operations for troubleshooting
- Automatically retries failed operations
- Exponential backoff for persistent errors

## Alliance Sync

### What is Alliance Sync?

During FRC competitions, teams often form alliances and need to share scouting data. Alliance Sync enables secure, controlled data sharing between alliance partners.

### Setting Up an Alliance

1. **Admin user** goes to **Alliances** > **Scouting Alliances**
2. Click **Create Alliance**
3. Enter alliance name (e.g., "Playoff Alliance 1")
4. Invite partner teams by team number
5. Partners receive invitation and can accept/decline

### Alliance Member Management

- **Owners** can invite/remove members
- **Members** can view shared data
- Members can leave alliance anytime
- All actions logged for audit trail

### Data Sharing in Alliances

**What gets shared:**
- Match scouting data for common opponents
- Team rankings and analysis
- Strategy notes (if opted in)
- Match predictions

**What does NOT get shared:**
- Pit scouting data (unless explicitly shared)
- Internal team notes marked "private"
- User account information
- Configuration settings

### Alliance Sync Frequency

- Real-time sync for active matches
- Every **30 seconds** for upcoming matches
- Every **3 minutes** for historical data
- On-demand sync available

### Security & Privacy

- Alliance data isolated from other teams
- Token-based authentication for all sync operations
- Members can revoke sharing anytime
- No data shared without explicit alliance membership
- Audit logs track all data access

## API Sync (External Data Sources)

### Dual API Support

Obsidian-Scout integrates with official FRC data sources:

#### FIRST API (Official)
- Event schedules
- Match results and scores
- Team registrations
- Rankings and standings

#### The Blue Alliance API
- Fallback if FIRST API unavailable
- Historical data access
- Additional statistics
- OPR/DPR/CCWM calculations

### Configuring API Sync

1. Go to **Admin Settings** > **Configuration** > **API Settings**
2. **For FIRST API:**
   - Enter username
   - Enter authorization token
   - Set base URL (default: https://frc-api.firstinspires.org)
3. **For The Blue Alliance:**
   - Enter API key (get from thebluealliance.com/account)
   - Set base URL (default: https://www.thebluealliance.com/api/v3)
4. Choose **preferred API source** (FIRST or TBA)
5. Enable **auto-sync** toggle
6. Set sync interval (default: 3 minutes)
7. Save configuration

### Auto-Sync Behavior

- Syncs current event automatically
- Updates team list for event
- Imports match schedule
- Updates match scores as they're posted
- Fallback to secondary API if primary fails
- Logs all API requests for debugging

### Manual API Sync

1. Go to **Teams** or **Matches** page
2. Click **Sync from API** button
3. Select event (or use current event)
4. Wait for completion notification
5. Review imported data

## Server-to-Server Sync

### Multi-Instance Deployments

For large teams or multi-site operations, multiple Obsidian-Scout servers can sync:

### Adding a Remote Server

1. Go to **Admin** > **Server Management**
2. Click **Add Server**
3. Enter server details:
   - Name (e.g., "Pit Computer")
   - Host URL (e.g., "https://192.168.1.50:8080")
   - API key for authentication
4. Test connection
5. Enable sync

### Sync Modes

**Full Sync:**
- Entire database synchronized
- Used for initial setup or major sync issues
- Can take several minutes

**Incremental Sync:**
- Only changes since last sync
- Runs every 1-5 minutes
- Efficient for ongoing operations

**Real-Time Forwarding:**
- Changes pushed immediately to other servers
- Sub-second latency
- Requires persistent connection

### File Synchronization

Beyond database sync, files also sync:
- Configuration files (game_config.json, pit_config.json)
- Uploaded images (pit photos, team logos)
- Custom page definitions
- Strategy drawing backgrounds

**Blocked from sync (safety):**
- Database files (*.db, *.sqlite)
- Log files
- SSL certificates
- Application code

## Sync Monitoring

### Sync Monitor Dashboard

1. Navigate to **Admin** > **Sync Monitor**
2. View live statistics:
   - Active connections
   - Queue sizes
   - Sync worker status
   - Recent operations
   - Error rates
3. Real-time updates via WebSocket

### Key Metrics

- **Queue Size**: Number of pending operations (should be near 0)
- **Worker Running**: Status of background sync worker
- **Last Sync**: Timestamp of most recent sync
- **Error Count**: Failed operations (investigate if >0)
- **Connected Devices**: Number of active WebSocket connections

### Troubleshooting Sync Issues

#### High Queue Size
- Indicates sync worker overloaded or stuck
- Check server logs for errors
- Restart sync worker (Admin > Restart Services)
- Consider reducing sync frequency

#### Sync Worker Not Running
- Worker may have crashed
- Check application logs
- Restart application
- Verify no database corruption

#### Frequent Disconnections
- Check network stability
- Verify firewall not blocking WebSocket
- Inspect browser console for errors
- Try different network

## Best Practices

### For Event Day

1. **Test sync before event**:
   - Verify all devices connect
   - Simulate high load
   - Test offline/online transitions

2. **Monitor throughout day**:
   - Check sync dashboard hourly
   - Watch for error spikes
   - Ensure critical devices syncing

3. **Backup strategy**:
   - Manual QR code transfer if sync fails
   - USB transfer as last resort
   - Keep offline backups

### For Alliance Partners

1. **Establish alliance early** (before quarterfinals)
2. **Verify data sharing working** (test match or two)
3. **Coordinate on strategy** (who scouts what)
4. **Regular sync checks** (especially before critical matches)

### For Multi-Server Setup

1. **Designate primary server** (authoritative for configs)
2. **Test failover** (ensure secondary can take over)
3. **Monitor lag** (should be <5 seconds)
4. **Backup regularly** (automated if possible)

## Technical Details

### WebSocket Protocol

- Uses Socket.IO library
- Supports HTTP/HTTPS
- Automatic transport fallback (WebSocket > polling)
- Custom event namespaces for isolation

### Database Change Tracking

- Timestamp-based change detection
- Incremental sync uses `updated_at` column
- Change log table for audit trail
- Conflict resolution: last-write-wins (configurable)

### Security Considerations

- All sync traffic encrypted (HTTPS/WSS)
- API keys for server-to-server auth
- Session cookies for user requests
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- IP whitelisting available for server sync
