# Alliance Membership Constraints

## One Active Alliance Rule

Starting with this update, teams can only be **active** in one alliance at a time. This constraint was implemented to prevent configuration conflicts and ensure a clear data flow.

### How It Works

1. **Multiple Memberships Allowed**: Teams can still be members of multiple scouting alliances
2. **Single Active Alliance**: Only one alliance can be "active" for a team at any given time
3. **Automatic Switching**: When a team activates a different alliance, any currently active alliance is automatically deactivated
4. **Clear Status Indicators**: The dashboard and alliance views clearly show which alliance is currently active

### User Experience Changes

#### Dashboard
- Shows which alliance is currently active with green highlighting and "ACTIVE" badge
- Displays status message at the top indicating active alliance or no active alliance

#### Alliance View
- Warning message explains the one-active-alliance constraint
- Alliance mode toggle automatically handles switching between alliances
- Informative messages when switching from one alliance to another

#### Invitation Process
- Teams cannot accept invitations to join new alliances while they have an active alliance
- Clear error message explains the constraint and suggests deactivating current alliance first

### Benefits

1. **Prevents Confusion**: Teams always know which alliance configuration they're using
2. **Avoids Data Conflicts**: No mixed configurations from multiple alliances
3. **Clear State Management**: Simplified alliance status tracking
4. **Better User Experience**: Clear visual indicators and helpful messaging

### Migration

- Existing teams with multiple active alliances will continue to work
- When they next activate an alliance, the constraint will take effect
- No data loss or configuration changes for existing setups

### Technical Implementation

- Database constraint ensures only one `TeamAllianceStatus` record per team
- Backend validation prevents conflicting alliance activations
- Frontend shows clear status and provides helpful error messages
- Automatic deactivation when switching alliances

This constraint improves the overall alliance system by providing clarity and preventing configuration conflicts while maintaining the flexibility for teams to participate in multiple alliances.
