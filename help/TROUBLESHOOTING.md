Comprehensive troubleshooting guide for common issues and their solutions.

## Quick Fixes

### Can't Log In
- **Check username and password** (case-sensitive)
- Verify **account is active** (admins can check user management)
- Clear browser **cookies and cache**
- Try **incognito/private mode** to rule out extension conflicts
- Ensure **scouting team number** is correct on login form

### Data Not Saving
- Check **internet connection** (look for connection indicator in navbar)
- Try **refreshing the page** (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
- Verify you're still **logged in** (session may have expired)
- Check if you have **permission** to edit (Scout vs. Analytics vs. Admin)
- Look for **error messages** in red banner at top of page

### Page Not Loading / Errors
- **Hard refresh**: Ctrl+Shift+R (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
- **Clear browser cache**: Settings > Privacy > Clear Data
- Try **different browser** (Chrome recommended)
- Check **browser console** for JavaScript errors (F12)
- Verify **server is running** (check URL/port)

## Authentication Issues

### 1. UNIQUE Constraint Failed on user.email

**Error Message:**
```
sqlalchemy.exc.IntegrityError: (sqlite3.IntegrityError) UNIQUE constraint failed: user.email
```

**Cause:** Multiple users with empty email addresses (NULL vs empty string inconsistency).

**Solution:**
```powershell
python fix_emails.py
```

This converts empty strings to NULL, allowing multiple users without emails.

### 2. Can't Login as Superadmin

**Default Credentials:**
- Username: `superadmin`
- Password: `password` (must change on first login)
- Auto-created by `run.py` on first run

**If superadmin doesn't exist:**
```powershell
python run.py
```
First run creates superadmin automatically.

**Reset superadmin password:**
```powershell
python reset_superadmin.py
```

### 3. Can't Login as Admin

**Reset admin account:**
```powershell
python other/reset_admin.py
```
Creates/resets admin user with password: `password`

**Manual reset via Python:**
```python
from app import create_app, db
from app.models import User

app = create_app()
with app.app_context():
    user = User.query.filter_by(username="admin").first()
    if user:
        user.set_password("password")
        db.session.commit()
        print("Password reset successfully")
```

### 4. Account Creation Locked

**Symptom:** Can't create new accounts, get "Account creation locked" message.

**Solution (Admin only):**
1. Log in as admin
2. Go to **User Management**
3. Click **Unlock Account Creation** toggle
4. New accounts can now be created

### 5. Role-Based Access Not Working

**Symptoms:**
- Can't access pages that should be available
- Redirected unexpectedly
- Features missing from navbar

**Solutions:**
1. **Check roles assigned**: User Management > Edit User > Verify roles
2. **Log out and back in**: Roles cached in session
3. **Clear cookies**: May have stale session data
4. **Verify team isolation**: Users only see their scouting team's data

**Role Permissions Reference:**
- **Admin**: Full access
- **Analytics**: All data/graphs, no user management
- **Scout**: Scouting forms only, no dashboard

### 6. Must Change Password Loop

**Symptom:** Forced to change password repeatedly after changing it.

**Cause:** `must_change_password` flag not clearing.

**Solution (Admin):**
```powershell
python
```
```python
from app import create_app, db
from app.models import User

app = create_app()
with app.app_context():
    user = User.query.filter_by(username="problematic_user").first()
    user.must_change_password = False
    db.session.commit()
```

## Database Issues

### 7. Database is Locked

**Error Message:**
```
sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (sqlite3.OperationalError) database is locked
```

**Causes:**
- Multiple processes accessing database simultaneously
- Previous crash left lock file
- Antivirus scanning database file

**Solutions:**

**Immediate fix:**
1. Stop all running instances of the application
2. Wait 10 seconds for lock release
3. Delete `instance/scouting.db-journal` if it exists
4. Restart application

**Persistent issues:**
1. Check for multiple `run.py` processes: Task Manager (Windows) or Activity Monitor (Mac)
2. Disable antivirus real-time scanning on `instance/` folder
3. Move database to faster storage (not network drive)

**Enable WAL mode (recommended):**
Database uses WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode automatically. Verify:
```powershell
sqlite3 instance/scouting.db
```
```sql
PRAGMA journal_mode;
```
Should return `wal`. If not:
```sql
PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;
.quit
```

### 8. No Such Table Errors

**Error Message:**
```
sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: no such table: <table_name>
```

**Cause:** Database schema not created or outdated.

**Solution:**

**Re-initialize database:**
```powershell
# Backup existing data first!
copy instance\\scouting.db instance\\scouting.db.backup

# Recreate tables
python
```
```python
from app import create_app, db

app = create_app()
with app.app_context():
    db.create_all()
```

**Use migrations (if available):**
```powershell
flask db upgrade
```

### 9. Database Corruption

**Symptoms:**
- Random errors during queries
- Data disappearing
- Application crashes
- Integrity check failures

**Diagnosis:**
```powershell
sqlite3 instance/scouting.db
```
```sql
PRAGMA integrity_check;
.quit
```

**Recovery steps:**
1. **Stop application immediately**
2. **Backup corrupted database**: `copy instance\\scouting.db instance\\scouting_corrupt.db`
3. **Attempt recovery**:
```powershell
sqlite3 instance/scouting_corrupt.db
```
```sql
.output instance/recovered.sql
.dump
.quit

sqlite3 instance/scouting_new.db
.read instance/recovered.sql
.quit
```
4. **Replace database**: `copy instance\\scouting_new.db instance\\scouting.db`
5. **Restart application**

**If recovery fails:**
- Restore from backup (should backup daily!)
- Re-sync from API (teams/matches)
- Manual data re-entry (scouting data)

## Configuration Issues

### 10. Game Configuration Not Loading

**Symptoms:**
- Scouting forms blank or missing fields
- Metrics not calculating
- Error: "Game config not found"

**Solutions:**

**Verify config file exists:**

- Copy contents to https://jsonlint.com
- Fix any syntax errors (missing commas, brackets)

**Reset to default:**
```powershell
# Backup current config
copy config\\game_config.json config\\game_config_backup.json

# Copy from defaults (choose your game)
copy config\\defaults\\2024_crescendo_config.json config\\game_config.json
```

**Re-load config (without restart):**
1. Go to **Admin Settings** > **Configuration**
2. Click **Reload Configuration**
3. Verify changes appear

### 11. Pit Configuration Issues

**Similar to game config, but for pit scouting.**

```

### 2. Database is locked

**Error Message:**
```
sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (sqlite3.OperationalError) database is locked
```

**Solution:**
This typically happens when multiple processes are accessing the database simultaneously:
1. Stop all running instances of the application
2. Wait a few seconds for the lock to be released
3. Restart the application

### 3. No such table: user

**Error Message:**
```
sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (sqlite3.OperationalError) no such table: user
```

**Solution:**
The database schema hasn't been created. Run the initialization script:
```
python init_auth.py
```

### 4. Can't login as admin or superadmin

**Solution:**
There are two convenience accounts used during setup:

- `superadmin` — auto-created by `run.py` on first run if no users exist. Default password is `password` and the account is created with `must_change_password=True` so you will be prompted to change it at first login.
- `admin` — can be created or reset at any time using the helper script located at `other/reset_admin.py`:

```
python other/reset_admin.py
```

The reset script will create or update the `admin` user with these credentials:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `password`

If you still cannot log in after using the script, check application logs for errors and ensure the database exists and is accessible.

### 5. Unable to add new users

**Possible causes and solutions:**
- **Duplicate username**: Choose a different username
- **Duplicate email**: Use a different email or leave blank
- **No roles selected**: At least one role must be selected

### 6. Role-based access not working correctly

If users can't access pages they should have permission for:
1. Check if they have the appropriate roles assigned
2. Try clearing browser cookies and cache
3. Log out and log back in

### 7. Error after database changes

If you make changes to the models.py file or database structure:
1. Back up your existing database
2. Delete the database file: `instance/scouting.db`
3. Run `python init_auth.py` to recreate the database

## Advanced Troubleshooting

### SQLite Database Inspection

To directly inspect the database:
```
sqlite3 instance/scouting.db
```

Useful SQLite commands:
```
.tables                   -- List all tables
.schema user              -- Show user table structure
SELECT * FROM user;       -- Show all users
SELECT * FROM role;       -- Show all roles
.quit                     -- Exit SQLite
```

### Manual Database Fix

If the fix script doesn't work, you can manually fix the database:
```
sqlite3 instance/scouting.db
UPDATE user SET email = NULL WHERE email = '';
.quit
```

### Completely Reset Authentication

If you want to start fresh with authentication:
```
sqlite3 instance/scouting.db
DELETE FROM user;
DELETE FROM user_roles;
.quit
python init_auth.py
```
