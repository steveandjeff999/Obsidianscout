Help index
==========

This directory contains user-facing help documents used by Obsidian Scout.

Quick links:
- ALLIANCE_CONSTRAINTS.md — Explains membership rules and the "one active alliance" constraint
- CONNECTIONS_AND_SYNC.md — Details sync mechanisms (including Alliance Sync)
- TROUBLESHOOTING.md — Common issues and remedies
- ADMIN_GUIDE.md — Admin-specific processes and tips

Recent updates:
- Inline help icons (small question-mark icons) were added to the Scouting Alliances UI to provide quick contextual guidance. These popovers can be disabled by toggling **Show inline help icons** in Settings.

If you want to add screenshots or GIFs showing how a popover looks on desktop vs mobile, add them to `help/media/` and update the relevant MD file with an image reference.
