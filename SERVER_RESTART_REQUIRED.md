#  IMPORTANT: Server Restart Required

## The Issue

The mobile API has been added to the code, but your server needs to be **restarted** to load the new routes.

## Solution

### Step 1: Stop the Current Server
If the server is running, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where it's running.

### Step 2: Start the Server
```bash
python run.py
```

### Step 3: Verify It's Working
Once the server starts, you should see output like:
```
Starting FRC Scouting Platform...
...
 Starting server...
```

### Step 4: Test the Mobile API

#### Quick Test (No Dependencies)
```bash
python check_mobile_api.py
```

#### Full Test (Requires requests module)
```bash
python test_mobile_api.py
```

Or test in your browser:
```
http://localhost:8080/api/mobile/health
```

You should see:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "status": "healthy",
  "version": "1.0",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

## If You Get 404 Error

If you get a 404 error, it means:
1. **Server not running** - Start it with `python run.py`
2. **Server needs restart** - Stop and restart the server
3. **Wrong URL** - Make sure you're using `http://localhost:8080/api/mobile/health`
4. **Import error** - Check server startup logs for any Python import errors

## Troubleshooting

### Check Server Logs
When you start the server, look for any errors in the output, especially:
- Import errors related to `mobile_api`
- Missing modules (like `jwt`)
- Registration errors

### Verify PyJWT is Installed
```bash
pip install PyJWT
```

### Test Server is Running
```bash
# In browser or curl:
http://localhost:8080/
```

The main page should load.

### Check the Mobile API Route
```bash
# In browser or curl:
http://localhost:8080/api/mobile/health
```

This should return JSON with `"success": true`.

## Common Issues

### "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'jwt'"
**Solution:**
```bash
pip install PyJWT
```
Then restart the server.

### "404 Not Found"
**Solution:**
- Make sure server is running
- Restart the server to load new routes
- Use correct URL: `http://localhost:8080/api/mobile/health`

### "Connection refused"
**Solution:**
- Server is not running
- Start it with: `python run.py`

### "SSL Error" or HTTPS Issues
**Solution:**
- Use HTTP not HTTPS: `http://localhost:8080`
- The test script has been updated to use HTTP

## Quick Verification Steps

1.  **PyJWT installed?** Run: `pip install PyJWT`
2.  **Server running?** Run: `python run.py`
3.  **Can access main site?** Visit: `http://localhost:8080/`
4.  **Can access API?** Visit: `http://localhost:8080/api/mobile/health`

## Next Steps After Server Restart

Once the server is running successfully:

1. **Test health endpoint** (no auth needed):
   ```bash
   http://localhost:8080/api/mobile/health
   ```

2. **Run the test script**:
   ```bash
   python test_mobile_api.py
   ```

3. **Read the documentation**:
   - `MOBILE_API_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Full API reference
   - `MOBILE_API_QUICKSTART.md` - Quick start guide

4. **Start building your mobile app!** 

## Need Help?

- Check server startup output for errors
- Look at server logs while making requests
- Verify all files were created correctly
- Make sure you're using the correct port (8080 by default)
