# Now Brief Feature - Update Summary

## Changes Made (October 8, 2025)

### 1. Position Change
- **Before**: Now Brief panel appeared at the top of the dashboard
- **After**: Now Brief panel now appears below the main dashboard content
- **Reason**: Better UX - users see core dashboard metrics first, then detailed brief

### 2. Dark Mode Improvements
- Added comprehensive dark mode support using `[data-bs-theme="dark"]` selectors
- Dark mode styles for:
  - Background colors (`.brief-bg-alt`)
  - Text colors (`.brief-text-muted`)
  - Borders (`.brief-border-side`)
  - All interactive elements (cards, items, badges)
  - Scrollbars
  - Alliance team badges with opacity adjustments
- Colors maintain readability in both light and dark themes

### 3. Data Display Fixes
- Fixed element ID conflict: `briefUpcomingMatches` (container) vs `briefUpcomingMatchesCount` (stat counter)
- Set default values to `0` instead of `-` for stats
- Added better error handling with console logging
- Added error messages in UI when data fails to load
- Improved data validation in API response handling

### 4. Match Click Navigation
- **Before**: Clicked matches went to `/matches/{id}` (match detail page)
- **After**: Clicked matches go to `/scouting?match_id={id}` (scouting page with match pre-selected)
- **Reason**: More practical workflow - users can immediately scout a match from the brief

### 5. CSS Improvements
- All text using theme-aware classes (`.brief-text-muted`)
- Backgrounds use theme-aware classes (`.brief-bg-alt`)
- Borders use theme-aware classes (`.brief-border-side`)
- Added hover effects for dark mode
- Better contrast ratios in dark mode
