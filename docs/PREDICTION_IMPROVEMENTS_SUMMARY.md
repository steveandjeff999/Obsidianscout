# Match Prediction Algorithm Improvements - Summary

## Date: October 14, 2025

## Overview
Significantly enhanced the match prediction algorithms to be much more accurate by implementing time-weighted data analysis, performance trend detection, consistency scoring, and improved Monte Carlo simulation.

---

## Key Changes

### 1. **Time-Weighted Data Analysis**
-  Implemented exponential decay weighting for match data
-  Recent matches now have more influence than older matches
-  Default decay factor: 0.15 (configurable)
-  Weights normalized to maintain comparable statistics

**Impact:** Predictions now properly reflect teams' current performance level rather than averaging all historical data equally.

### 2. **Performance Trend Detection**
-  Added `_calculate_trend_factor()` function
-  Uses weighted linear regression (numpy) when available
-  Detects improving teams (factor > 1.0) and declining teams (factor < 1.0)
-  Fallback method for when numpy unavailable
-  Capped between 0.85 and 1.15 to prevent extreme adjustments

**Impact:** Predictions now account for teams that are getting better or worse throughout the event.

### 3. **Consistency Scoring**
-  Added `_calculate_consistency_factor()` function
-  Calculates coefficient of variation using weighted statistics
-  Rewards teams with predictable, consistent performance
-  Factor ranges from 0.9 to 1.0
-  Penalizes erratic, unreliable performance

**Impact:** More reliable predictions for consistent teams; appropriate uncertainty for inconsistent teams.

### 4. **Enhanced Monte Carlo Simulation**
-  Increased simulations from 2,000 to 3,000
-  Consistency-adjusted standard deviations
-  Added alliance synergy bonus (up to 2%)
-  Better uncertainty modeling
-  More accurate probability distributions

**Impact:** More statistically accurate predictions with better confidence intervals.

### 5. **Weighted Statistics Throughout**
-  All metrics now use time-weighted calculations
-  Weighted mean: `Σ(value × weight) / Σ(weight)`
-  Weighted variance and standard deviation
-  Applied to auto, teleop, endgame, and total points

**Impact:** All metrics properly reflect recent performance over historical averages.

## Technical Specifications

### Exponential Weighting Formula
```python
weight = exp(-decay_factor × age)
normalized_weight = weight × n / Σ(weights)
```

### Trend Factor Calculation
```python
# Using numpy (preferred)
slope = polyfit(x, values, degree=1, weights=w)[0]
normalized_slope = slope / mean_value
trend_factor = 1.0 + (normalized_slope × n_matches)
trend_factor = clamp(trend_factor, 0.85, 1.15)

# Fallback method
first_half_avg = mean(values[:mid])
second_half_avg = mean(values[mid:])
trend_factor = second_half_avg / first_half_avg
trend_factor = clamp(trend_factor, 0.85, 1.15)
```

### Consistency Factor Calculation
```python
weighted_mean = Σ(value × weight) / Σ(weight)
weighted_variance = Σ(weight × (value - mean)²) / Σ(weight)
std_dev = sqrt(weighted_variance)
coefficient_of_variation = std_dev / mean
consistency_factor = 1.0 / (1.0 + CV × 0.5)
consistency_factor = clamp(consistency_factor, 0.9, 1.0)
```

### Final Score Calculation
```python
base_score = Σ(value × weight) / Σ(weight)
final_score = base_score × trend_factor × consistency_factor
```

### Alliance Synergy Bonus
```python
if len(alliance) >= 3:
    avg_consistency = mean(team_consistencies)
    synergy_bonus = alliance_score × 0.02 × avg_consistency
    final_score = alliance_score + synergy_bonus
```

## Usage

### Running Predictions (No Changes Required)
The improvements are automatic and transparent. All existing prediction code continues to work:

```python
from app.utils.analysis import predict_match_outcome

prediction = predict_match_outcome(match_id)
# Returns enhanced prediction with time-weighted, trend-aware results
```

### Accessing New Metrics
```python
from app.utils.analysis import calculate_team_metrics

metrics = calculate_team_metrics(team_id, event_id)

# Access new fields
base_score = metrics['metrics']['total_points_base']
trend = metrics['metrics']['trend_factor']
consistency = metrics['metrics']['consistency_factor']
final_score = metrics['metrics']['total_points']

print(f"Team performance: {final_score:.1f} pts")
print(f"Trend: {'improving' if trend > 1 else 'declining' if trend < 1 else 'stable'}")
print(f"Consistency: {'high' if consistency > 0.95 else 'moderate' if consistency > 0.92 else 'variable'}")
```

### Testing the Improvements
```bash
# Run test suite
python test_improved_predictions.py

# Evaluate with historical data
python scripts/evaluate_predictions.py --event EVENT_CODE
```

---

## Configuration Options

### Decay Factor (affects time-weighting)
```python
# In calculate_team_metrics()
weights = _calculate_exponential_weights(scouting_data, decay_factor=0.15)

# Options:
# 0.10 = gradual decay, all matches important
# 0.15 = default, balanced approach
# 0.20 = aggressive decay, recent matches prioritized
# 0.25 = very aggressive, focus on latest performance
```

### Simulation Count (affects accuracy vs speed)
```python
# In predict_match_outcome()
sim = _simulate_match_outcomes(..., n_simulations=3000)

# Options:
# 1500 = faster, less accurate
# 3000 = default, good balance
# 5000 = slower, higher accuracy
```

### Trend Factor Limits
```python
# In _calculate_trend_factor()
trend_factor = max(0.85, min(1.15, trend_factor))

# Adjust for more/less sensitivity:
# (0.75, 1.25) = wider range, more responsive
# (0.90, 1.10) = narrower range, more conservative
```

### Issue: Recent matches too influential
**Solution:** Decrease decay factor to 0.10

### Issue: Predictions changing rapidly
**Solution:** Increase decay factor or narrow trend limits

## Conclusion

The improved prediction algorithms provide significantly more accurate match predictions by:
-  Properly weighting recent data over older data
-  Detecting and accounting for performance trends
-  Rewarding consistent, predictable performance
