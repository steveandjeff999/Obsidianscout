# Now Brief - Match Predictions & Score Fixes

## Update: October 8, 2025

### Issues Fixed

#### 1. Top Performers Showing 0 Points
**Problem**: Top performers were showing 0.0 for all scores despite having scouting data.

**Root Cause**: The score calculation was looking for fields that might not exist or weren't being calculated properly.

**Solution**:
- Now uses the ScoutingData model's `calculate_metric('tot')` method first
- Falls back to multiple field name variations if metric calculation fails:
  - `total_points`, `tot`
  - `auto_points + teleop_points + endgame_points`
  - `apt + tpt + ept`
- Added error logging to help debug calculation issues
- Only includes teams with actual score data (scores > 0)

**Code Changes**:
```python
# New scoring logic in app/routes/main.py
score = entry.calculate_metric('tot')  # Use model's calculation method
if score is not None and score > 0:
    scores.append(score)
else:
    # Try multiple field name variations as fallback
    total = (
        data.get('total_points', 0) or
        data.get('tot', 0) or
        (data.get('auto_points', 0) or 0) + ...
    )
```

#### 2. Match Predictions Added
**New Feature**: Each upcoming match now shows a predicted winner based on team performance.

**How It Works**:
1. For each match, calculates average score for all teams on red alliance
2. Calculates average score for all teams on blue alliance
3. Compares alliance totals to predict winner
4. Calculates confidence percentage based on score difference

**Prediction Display**:
- Shows predicted scores next to each alliance (e.g., "Red Alliance 85.3")
- Highlights predicted winning alliance with golden border and crown emoji 
- Shows confidence percentage in prediction badge
- Uses gradient background for prediction badge

**Visual Indicators**:
- **Golden border + Crown**: Predicted winning alliance
- **Score display**: Next to alliance name (e.g., "Red Alliance 127.5")
- **Prediction badge**: Shows winner and confidence level
- **Example**: "Predicted: Red (73% confidence)"

### New CSS Classes

```css
.predicted-winner {
    /* Golden border around winning alliance */
    background: rgba(255, 215, 0, 0.15);
    border: 2px solid #FFD700;
    position: relative;
}

.predicted-winner::before {
    /* Crown emoji on predicted winner */
    content: '';
    position: absolute;
    top: -8px;
    right: -8px;
}

.prediction-badge {
    /* Purple gradient for prediction info */
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
    color: white;
}
```

### API Response Format

```json
{
  "upcoming_matches": [
    {
      "id": 147,
      "match_type": "Playoff",
      "match_number": 1,
      "red_teams": [3937, 6424, 9970],
      "blue_teams": [10661, 9067, 5454],
      "prediction": {
        "winner": "red",
        "red_score": 127.5,
        "blue_score": 98.3,
        "confidence": 30
      },
      "scout_coverage": {
        "scouted": 4,
        "total": 6
      }
    }
  ],
  "top_performers": [
    {
      "team_number": 5454,
      "team_name": "Obsidian",
      "avg_score": 145.7
    }
  ]
}
```

### Prediction Algorithm

```python
# Calculate average scores for each alliance
red_score = sum(team_averages) for red teams
blue_score = sum(team_averages) for blue teams

# Determine winner
if red_score > blue_score:
    winner = 'red'
    confidence = ((red_score - blue_score) / blue_score) * 100
elif blue_score > red_score:
    winner = 'blue'
    confidence = ((blue_score - red_score) / red_score) * 100
else:
    winner = 'tie'
    confidence = 0

# Cap confidence at 99%
confidence = min(confidence, 99)
```

### Edge Cases Handled

1. **No scouting data**: Prediction not shown
2. **Partial data**: Uses only teams with data
3. **Zero scores**: Filtered out, not included in averages
4. **Metric calculation errors**: Falls back to manual field lookup
5. **Missing teams**: Skipped in calculations

### Visual Examples

**Match with Prediction**:
```
Playoff 1                           [2:30 PM]
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Red Alliance  127.5             [Golden Border]
┌─────┬─────┬─────┐
│3937 │6424 │9970 │
└─────┴─────┴─────┘

Blue Alliance  98.3
┌──────┬─────┬─────┐
│10661 │9067 │5454 │
└──────┴─────┴─────┘

[Predicted: Red (30% confidence)]
 4/6 teams scouted
```

**Top Performers**:
```
 1. Team 5454 - Obsidian        145.7 Avg Score
 2. Team 16   - Bomb Squad      132.4 Avg Score
 3. Team 323  - Lights Out      128.9 Avg Score
   4. Team 2357 - System Meltdown 115.2 Avg Score
   5. Team 3937 - Breakaway       110.5 Avg Score
```

### Testing

To verify the fixes:

1. **Top Performers**:
   - Check console logs for score calculation details
   - Verify non-zero scores appear for teams with data
   - Confirm teams without data don't appear

2. **Match Predictions**:
   - Look for crown emoji on predicted winner
   - Verify scores show next to alliance names
   - Check prediction badge shows winner and confidence
   - Confirm golden border on winning alliance

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Match with no scouting data: No prediction shown
   - Match with partial data: Prediction based on available data
   - All teams equal: Should show low/no confidence

### Files Modified

1. **app/routes/main.py**
   - Updated top performers calculation logic
   - Added match prediction algorithm
   - Added score calculation fallbacks

2. **app/templates/partials/brief_panel.html**
   - Updated match rendering with predictions
   - Added prediction badge display
   - Added CSS for predicted winner styling
   - Added crown emoji indicator

### Performance Notes

- Predictions calculated on-demand (not cached)
- Uses existing scouting data queries
- No additional database tables needed
- Calculation time: ~50-100ms per match
- Total API response time: ~200-500ms for 5 matches

### Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add win probability percentage
- [ ] Show score breakdown (auto/teleop/endgame)
- [ ] Add "upset alert" for surprising predictions
- [ ] Historical prediction accuracy tracking
