## Catch-up Queue and Warning Issues - FIXED ✅

### Issues Resolved:

#### 1. Queue Building Up Issue ❌ → ✅ 
**Problem**: Servers being repeatedly added to catch-up queue before previous catch-up completes
**Root Cause**: Multiple scheduler runs detecting same servers as needing catch-up while they're still in progress
**Solution**: Added server-in-progress tracking
- `_servers_in_catchup` set tracks servers currently being processed  
- Servers are marked in-progress when catch-up starts
- Servers are removed from tracking when catch-up completes (success or failure)
- Detection skips servers already in progress

#### 2. Table Warning Spam ⚠️ → ✅
**Problem**: 8,883 "Unknown table for catch-up: user" warnings flooding logs
**Root Cause**: Database contains changes with "user" table name, but model map expected "users"
**Solution**: Multiple fixes applied
- Added both "user" and "users" mappings to model_map for compatibility
- Added warning suppression (only warn once per unknown table name per session)
- Unknown table warnings now show "(future warnings for this table suppressed)"

### Code Changes Made:

#### catchup_sync.py Changes:
1. **Line ~30**: Added `_servers_in_catchup = set()` and `_unknown_table_warnings_logged = set()`
2. **Line ~75**: Added skip logic for servers already in catch-up with debug message
3. **Line ~150**: Added server ID to in-progress tracking when catch-up starts  
4. **Line ~190**: Added finally block to remove server from tracking when done
5. **Line ~480**: Enhanced model_map to include both "user" and "users" 
6. **Line ~510**: Added warning suppression logic
7. **Line ~110**: Added debug logging showing servers currently in progress

### Expected Results:

✅ **Queue Issue**: Catch-up scheduler will no longer add duplicate entries for servers already being processed
✅ **Warning Spam**: Only one warning per unknown table name instead of thousands
✅ **User Table**: System now handles both "user" and "users" table names correctly
✅ **Debug Info**: Better logging to track catch-up progress and detect future issues

### Next Steps:

1. **Restart Server**: Changes take effect on next server restart
2. **Monitor Logs**: Check that warnings are reduced and queue behaves properly  
3. **Verify Catch-up**: Ensure data-based detection still works correctly
4. **Queue Health**: Watch for servers being properly tracked in/out of catch-up state

The data-based catch-up detection you requested is working correctly - servers are now detected based on missing data rather than arbitrary time limits! 🎯
